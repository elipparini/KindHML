# KindHML v1 — Progress log

Branch `v1` (worktree `~/Desktop/gitlab/KindHML-v1`). The old tool stays on `main`
(`~/Desktop/gitlab/KindHML`) for differential testing. Work stops after each milestone.

## Milestones

- [x] **M1** Worktree, design note (`DESIGN.md`), Kind 2 experiments.
- [ ] **M2** Grammar, AST, type checker; parse tests on all benchmarks and regressions.
- [ ] **M3** Desugaring, `Trans` encoding, Lustre printer; unit tests; reference evaluator.
- [ ] **M4** Formula encoding, full pipeline, regressions imported; all ground truths checked.
- [ ] **M5** Contract-to-contract calls; README; `run_experiments.sh`; `\CL` notes in the paper.

## M1 — Kind 2 experiments (Kind 2 v2.3.0-467, cvc5 1.1.1)

The test files are in `experiments/kind2/`; the conclusions are:

1. A property may call a Lustre `function` whose arguments contain quantified variables only if
   the function is *inlinable*. Functions over records, enums, and scalars are inlinable, also
   with local variables and nested calls. Functions over **arrays** are not.
   ⇒ maps are records with one field per address; each level of `S^i` is a local record.
2. Nested modalities as nested calls `trans(trans(s, t1), t2)` work (k-induction proves them).
3. Quantifying over a **record** type (`exists (t: Tx)`) gives correct answers but makes BMC
   and k-induction crash (`Ltree.fold : quantified term`), leaving only IC3.
   ⇒ quantified variables are scalars; `args` variables are expanded.
4. With scalar quantifiers only the invariant generator raises that exception; it is harmless.
5. `-json` output gives, per property: `answer.value` (`valid`/`falsifiable`/...), `answer.source`
   (engine), `k`, `runtime`, and a counterexample.

## Decisions taken after M1 (with the user)

1. **Domain of `address` quantifiers:** all addresses except `null` (users and contracts).
   A new predicate `is_EOA(e)` holds iff `e` is a user address (not `null`, not a contract).
   Rules whose ground truth assumes users only (e.g. `mapping1` `P1_true`) get an explicit
   `is_EOA(a) ->` guard; every such change of a benchmark is listed in M4.
2. **Unconstructed states:** `φ` is checked in the reachable states where every contract is
   constructed (the property is `(∧_C constructed_C) → Φ(φ)`).
3. **Contract names in modalities:** an unknown name is a type error; `Pricebet` (price-bet)
   and `Addittivity` (regression additivity) are corrected in the files.
